"Beneath the Quiet Sky"

Beneath the quiet sky so wide,
Dreams like rivers gently glide,
Whispers float on winds that roam,
Carrying thoughts from hearts to home.

Woohhh

Walk the path, though shadows fall,
The moon will rise and light it all.
Each step you take, each breath you bear,
Is part of magic everywhere.
