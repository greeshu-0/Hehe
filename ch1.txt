"Beneath the Quiet Sky"

Beneath the quiet sky so wide,
Dreams like rivers gently glide,
Whispers float on winds that roam,
Carrying thoughts from hearts to home.

Stars that flicker, soft and small,
Seem to answer every call.
Even in nightâ€™s deepest hue,
Hope still shines in silver blue.

Walk the path, though shadows fall,
The moon will rise and light it all.
Each step you take, each breath you bear,
Is part of magic everywhere.
