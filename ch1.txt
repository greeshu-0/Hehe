I’m Jagarapu Greeshma, a passionate and curious learner deeply interested in web development, AI/ML, and IoT. I enjoy building real-world projects that combine technology and creativity—like my recent "Smart Street Light for Women's Safety" initiative, where I worked on both machine learning and the responsive dashboard. I’m comfortable with C++, Python, and full-stack development, and I’m currently enhancing my skills through focused 7-week learning plans across Machine Learning, DSA, and Web Development. I also love exploring new hobbies like learning languages, journaling, and experimenting with music and video editing, always striving to grow in diverse and meaningful ways.
