"Echoes of Me"

I am the flame that flickers low,
Yet still I burn, and still I glow.
I am the rain on summer’s face,
A fleeting touch, a soft embrace.

I’m pages turned in quiet rooms,
A song that hums through twilight gloom.
I’m dreams that drift on morning air,
Half-remembered, always there.

I bend, I break, I rise, I run—
A shadow dancing with the sun.
Not all who wander lose their way,
Some simply bloom in shades of gray.
