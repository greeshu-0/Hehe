🌙 “In Between the Lines”

In silent hours, when dreams run deep,
I gather stars I cannot keep.
A heart that feels both fire and rain,
Still dances gently through the pain.

I changed file...

Not always loud, but always strong,
I hum my truth, a quiet song.
And though the world may rush or spin,
I plant my roots and grow within.
